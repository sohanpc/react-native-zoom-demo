# Dummy Backend API

This is just a dummy backend. All files in this folder should be implemented on your Backend API

Your react-native app should request the backend for:
1. a JWT token to initialize zoom sdk that is used in `ZoomUs.initialize` - implemented in `getSdkJwtToken`
2. a JWT token to start a meeting that is used in `ZoomUs.startMeeting` - implementation in `TODO`
